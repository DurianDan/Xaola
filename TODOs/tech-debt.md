- `scrape/scraper_crawlee/src/TheSalesman/config/elements.ts`:
    - problem: the map of elements has both **XPATH** and **CSS selectors** mixed in.
    - recommend solutions:
        - Modified all `PuppetMaster` to accept only **CSS selectors**
        - Use the defined **CSS selectors alternatives**, in the comment section at the end of the `elements.ts` file
